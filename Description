This program was developed in Google Colab to perform machine learning classification of atmospheric Cherenkov telescope data. The goal is to distinguish between events produced by primary gamma rays (signal) and those generated by hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays (background).
Using the dataset described above, the workflow consists of data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of supervised learning algorithms. The input features are derived from the image parameters of the Cherenkov shower, including Hillas parameters, cluster shape descriptors, and statistical asymmetries along the major axis. These features provide a discriminative basis for separating gamma-induced events from hadronic background.
The program implements classification models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics to ensure reliable discrimination between gamma and hadron classes.By automating this classification process, the program demonstrates how machine learning can enhance astrophysical data analysis, improving the identification of high-energy gamma events in ground-based Cherenkov telescopes.
