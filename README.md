# MAGIC: Gamma vs. Hadron Classification

This program was developed in **Google Colab** to perform machine learning classification of atmospheric Cherenkov telescope data.  
The goal is to distinguish between events produced by **primary gamma rays (signal)** and those generated by **hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays (background)**.

## 🔬 Workflow

- **Data preprocessing**  
- **Feature selection**  
- **Supervised learning algorithms**

The input features are derived from the image parameters of the Cherenkov shower, including **Hillas parameters**, cluster shape descriptors, and statistical asymmetries along the major axis.  
These features provide a discriminative basis for separating gamma-induced events from hadronic background.

## ⚙️ Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Ensemble Methods  

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- ROC-AUC

## 🚀 Results and Impact

By automating this classification process, the program demonstrates how **machine learning** can enhance astrophysical data analysis, improving the identification of **high-energy gamma events** in ground-based Cherenkov telescopes.
